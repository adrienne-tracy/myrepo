# myrepo

This repository contains a demo of the phytoplankton
web app that we are building in Shiny. 

This contains DMR phytoplankton data and Bigelow PSP
toxin forecasting. 

The Shiny app is stored in the DMR Shiny server. This contains all of the csv files, data frame manipulations, and packages required for uploading and formmating the data for the app.
